# Filename: HeartRate.py                                          #
# Language: Python 3                                              #
# Purpose:  Creating a program that will talk with the database   #
#           and Microbits                                         #
#                                                                 #
# To run my program you must know the file location and then cd   #
# to that location using putty on the acad server.                #
# Then you will enter "python H.py".                              #

# Function Name: infiniteloop2                                         #
# Description: This function listens for data from the heart rate      #
#              sensor, and pushes the data to Firebase for storage.    #
# Parameters:  N/A - It takes in data via serial port, not parameters  #
# Return Value: N/A - There is nothing to return for another function, #
#               it pushes the data straight to Firebase                #
#                                                                      #
